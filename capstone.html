                        I must admit, growing up I never thought that hard about how my parents managed to organize our family vacations - from booking hotel reservations to purchasing plane tickets to even navigating during those infamous road trips before Google Maps existed. Only recently as an adult have I really begun to dip my toes into the world of trip planning - And answering the initial question “where will we stay?” was an excellent introduction to realizing how difficult it can get. 
                        </br></br>
                        In my experience, successfully communicating back and forth with trip members, saving locations of interest, and recalling everyones thoughts was a lot less straightforward than I realized. I wanted to learn about what this experience is like for others and if there was a tool I could design that could help other trip planners efficiently evaluate their options and find their “perfect place” together.

                        Rental Booking sites often provide tools users need to filter available listings down by certain criteria. While this is the case, the capabilities of these tools are limited. Aside from being able to filter your search and view listings on a map, the rest is up to the user to determine by reviewing each listing by themselves or with others. I found that there doesn’t seem to be a tool that supports a user’s process of elimination individually or as a group effort to come to a decision - which arguably is one of the harder parts of trip planning.

                        I wanted to learn if this was a problem for others too. I first went online to learn about how people feel about this and what resources were out there - specifically with finding a place to stay online. While I couldn’t find an existing comparison tool, I instead found a countless amount of articles from people sharing their best tricks and strategies to find the best booking option.

                    </br>
                        So while I couldn’t find a statement that declared this was an issue,  it was clear that there was 
                        some strategy required for this.

                    <p>To further my understanding of what this process looked like for others, I scoped out a few participants who could tell me about their personal experiences with booking stays online and what their methods are to eliminate their options, communicate with others, and maintain their priorities.

                    I spoke to 5 individuals who were screened to have some experience with trip planning and booking a stay online. I asked each participant in the beginning of the interview to recall one trip and proceeded with my questions.  I gained a lot of insight from these interviews. I learned about how their decisions were made and what factors they were keeping in mind during the process.

                    <p>After the interviews, I compiled together all of the quotes from my participants that captured key thoughts they had during their decision making process that helped qualify if a place could remain in the standing for options.

                    <p>One of the most interesting findings I discovered was that when it comes to available filters on booking sites, all of my participants only use the price and location filter. While this is the case, everyone still felt willing to adjust their price depending on the trip. And after filtering these things everyone had a method to eliminate their options further.

                    This confirmed to me that people did in fact need to narrow down their choices in a way that existing tools currently don’t help facilitate. 
                    And at this point, I was able to also refine my initial question “Is there a solution?”  to something more focused:

                    Trip planning is exciting, but Kaitlin recognizes that she’ll have to really sit down to thoroughly scope out her options and communicate them to her friends. She will be keeping track of options possibly on multiple websites like Airbnb and Hotel.com. She’ll also have to take her friend's input into account and have a discussion regarding their options and which one is best to choose.

                    <p>Taking into account the processes that my interviewees shared they use, Kaitlin's process in finalizing a place would probably include something like keeping track of all her options on spreadsheets/multiple tabs/lists, communicating these to her friends, friends opening up the links and analyzing themselves, communicating back and forth to settle on an idea, and deciding at the end</p>

I liked the use of space and thin lines/text because it made the screen feel organized, clean, and not overwhelming. In terms of colors, I wanted to keep the application bright and use color meaningfully like some of the examples I found. For instance, one app uses different colors to represent different events on a calendar.   </p>

                        If I were to continue this project, I would like to focus more on bringing more life to the social component of the app and making that more visible whether that be inviting wording or changing the location and colors of the button. I learned from my user testing that the social component is actually the highlight of the tool so I would even consider bringing those features out in the main display instead of being hidden at first. 
                    </br></br>
                    I also feel that the best application of this tool would be as an add on to an existing booking site like Airbnb or Vrbo. This way the user can still access the search features to find additional places and have a more whole, complete experience from the start of searching to the end of finding their most ideal listing.
                    </p></br>
