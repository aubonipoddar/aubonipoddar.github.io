                        I must admit, growing up I never thought that hard about how my parents managed to organize our family vacations - from booking hotel reservations to purchasing plane tickets to even navigating during those infamous road trips before Google Maps existed. Only recently as an adult have I really begun to dip my toes into the world of trip planning - And answering the initial question “where will we stay?” was an excellent introduction to realizing how difficult it can get.
                        </br></br>
                        In my experience, successfully <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">communicating back and forth </span>with trip members, <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">saving locations of interest</span>, and <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">recalling everyones thoughts</span> was a lot less straightforward than I realized.

                    <p>
                        Rental Booking sites often provide tools users need to filter available listings down by certain criteria. While this is the case, <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">the capabilities of these tools are limited</span>. Aside from being able to filter your search and view listings on a map, the rest is up to the user to determine by reviewing each listing by themselves or with others. </br></br> I found that <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">there doesn’t seem to be a tool that supports a user’s process of elimination </span>individually or as a group effort to come to a decision - which arguably is one of the harder parts of trip planning.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">I first went online to learn about how people feel about this and what resources were out there</span> - specifically with finding a place to stay online. While I couldn’t find an existing comparison tool, I instead found a countless amount of articles from people sharing their best tricks and strategies to find the best booking option.

                    </br>
                        So while I couldn’t find a statement that declared this was an issue,  <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">it was clear that there was 
                        some strategy required for this. </span>

                    <p>To further my understanding of what this process looked like for others, I scoped out a few participants who could tell me about their <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">personal experiences </span>with booking stays online and what their <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">methods</span> are to eliminate their options, communicate with others, and maintain their priorities.

                    I spoke to 5 individuals who were screened to have some experience with trip planning and booking a stay online. I asked each participant in the beginning of the interview to <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">recall one trip</span> and proceeded with my questions.  I gained a lot of insight from these interviews. <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">I learned about how their decisions were made and what factors they were keeping in mind during the process. </span>

                <p>When it comes to available filters on booking sites, all of my participants only use the price and location filter. While this is the case, everyone still felt willing to adjust their price depending on the trip. And after filtering these things <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">everyone had a method to eliminate their options further</span>.

                        If I were to continue this project, I would like to focus more on <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">bringing more life to the social component </span>of the app and making that more visible whether that be inviting wording or changing the location and colors of the button. I learned from my user testing that the social component is actually the highlight of the tool so I would even consider bringing those features out in the main display instead of being hidden at first. 
                    </br></br>
                    I also feel that the best application of this tool would be as an <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">add-on </span>to an existing booking site like Airbnb or Vrbo. This way the user can still access the search features to find additional places and have a more whole, complete experience from the start of searching to the end of finding their most ideal listing.
                    </p></br>
