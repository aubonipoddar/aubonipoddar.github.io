      <h2>about me</h2>

      <p>Hello! My name is Auboni and I'm currently an undergrad at UC Davis studying Design and Computer Science.<br><br>
        I've always had an appreciation for visual aesthetics, but as Iâ€™ve deepened my understanding on the impact design has on connecting, solving, and overall improving complexities in the world, I feel more passionate than ever to contribute myself!<br><br>

  Designing to improve experiences to me means that from meaningful evaluation and strategy, we can
  minimize problems to maximize enjoyment, ease, and growth for our community! <br><br>To think that design has the capacity to make an experience
  feel (even just for a second) better than ordinary for someone makes me strive to be able to utilize it.<br><br>
  Currently I am interested in gaining professional experience in UI/UX Design! Feel free to contact me to chat and connect at:<span style="color:#3195D9;"> apoddar@ucdavis.edu</span>!<br>
