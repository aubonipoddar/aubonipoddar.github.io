                        My team began our collaboration with Sofvie with their team explaining to us that they would like us to <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">design a client/customer success operations dashboard </span> with their Data

                    <p>In our discussion, we clarified with the team what their base expectations were design wise and content wise. The goal for my team in this initial meeting was to clarify who would be using this dashboard, what they were looking to get out of this project, and how we could check in and communicate with them frequently to ensure that we meet their expectations.

While this is the case, this dashboard should work and operate the same for all of them (personalization was a future goal for them with this dashboard).</p>
                    <p>From our understanding, the data science team generated this list based off of discussions they've had with the stakeholders of the company.

                    <p>We created an open card sort activity on Figjam and wrote out each data point onto a sticky note. After having a brief conversation with each key leader about their roles, current processes to come to the conclusions this future dashboard would aid in, and what they had in mind for this dashboard we prompted them with this to hear from their perspective and learn what groupings make sense and hold value to them.

                    We asked each interviewee to take time to review the data points and ask for any clarification needed. Next, we asked them to begin to pull out the points that would be of interest to them and group them in a way that served them best. 
                    </br></br>
                    We also requested that they voice their thoughts as they go through this so that we could understand their thought process and reasoning. To provide some direction in getting started, we listed out the following considerations but emphasized that they were not necessary to follow to minimize any bias on our end:

                    <p>What we didn’t anticipate, however, was the <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">division</span> in what the key leaders had in mind for the <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">level of complexity</span> and <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">information</span> desired for this dashboard. </p>

                        <p>In particular, during our last interview with the CFO we learned that he had something significantly more simple in mind and actually ruled out several data points included in the list due to confidentiality reasons. Essentially, he had envisioned a simpler version of the specs provided to us by the data analytics team and shared he will hold the most influence when it comes to the actual production of this.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, during the interviews, stakeholders brought up new data points that they would find helpful as well viewing these points at a company level and site level and being able to compare the data to a different time period.</p>

                        As we began to review the groupings from each key leader’s card sort, we were challenged with trying to find some common ground in their results. Our approach was to utilize the home page as the area with the most important points among key leaders.</br></br>

                        I came up with an idea of coloring all of the data points that at least 2 key leaders pulled out of the full list pink. Next I suggested creating three rows ordered by a hierarchy of influence. I put the CFO’s data points together that he saw as the ideal homepage and put the 2 key leaders and data science team under. From here we began to eliminate data points that did not seem to hold enough priority and could therefore be relocated to their respective tabs in the dashboard .

            Making Executive Decisions
        </h2>
    
        <p>At this point, it was becoming more clear that the data science team’s specs may not align best with the CFO and the key leaders. Because we had the opportunity to communicate with all three groups of people at the company, we determined moving forward it would be best for us to vouch for our design and pitch a modified version that better aligned with all the feedback we recieved from all three groups of people at the company.
        </br></br>
        One major addition to the dashboard was introducing two levels to view all data on the dashboard. The first level was by company, allowing users to view statistics for a particular company that uses their products if desired instead of the default option which is all companies combined. The second level was by site. The companies that use Sofvie’s products may have multiple sites where workers are located and physically working. The CFO explained that having these insights by site would be incredibly beneficial in their analysis. 
        </br></br>                        <img id="graph" style ="width:100%"src="sof_compicker.png" alt="shark rawr">

        We also included a time range so that the user could not only compare during a custom range, but also allow a comparison of data points in a given time range to the previous week, 30 days, last billing period, etc. 
        </br></br><img id="graph" style ="width:100%"src="sof_daterange.png" alt="shark rawr">
        We communicated our plans with the data science team and planned to present our low fidelity dashboard with these changes in mind to get more input and approval. This allowed us to proceed with working through our card sort results/discussions and group the data points into three pages: The Home Page, Page 1, and Page 2 (as we couldn't find the right word at the time).

                    I learned about the process on the data science team to retrieve all of this data and how these points are made by linking bits of information they have access to to generate a meaningful point. From this, we learned what graphs could be modified, added, and what graphs that were listed on the specs weren’t possible at all, simply because they didn’t have the data needed to generate it.
                    </br></br>
                    In this session we also communicated the concerns we heard from our interviews, for example the CFO’s reluctance to implement a Chat GPT feature. He felt that having a feature to auto generate text for things like emails might compromise the authenticity of the relationships the company has made with their clients. Communicating our findings at this session was helpful in getting everyone on the same page and on board with the low fidelity prototype, meaning we could move forward to high fidelity.

Next we prompted them with tasks to assess how straightforward the interface is. We asked them to voice their thoughts as well to learn about what they are expecting buttons to do and what they are looking for to accomplish a certain step in the task.

                    The feedback we received across all key stakeholders ended up being quite positive! Aside from minor fixes and suggestions, everyone was satisfied with the functionality of the dashboard and the information it provided and they were grouped.</p>

        <p> We met with the data science team one last time and made last touches to our prototype to prepare for our handoff. We additionally supplied them with all of the resources we used as examples from Chart.js and Python for our chart visualizations, all major/minor changes we made to the initial project specs provided by the data science team, and all remaining uncertainties we had that will have to be resolved internally within the Sofvie team on logistics that were out of our scope of involvement.</p>

Communication is Key                </h2>
            
                <p>
                I learned as a designer and being part of this process from start to finish the value of talking to key stakeholders. Early on, we learned that there was a disconnect between the groups at Sofvie on what they wanted for this dashboard. Communication played a huge role in resolving this and checking in helped us keep everyone up to date and in agreement - it allowed us to improve this project for the better and resulted in a successful project that everyone was happy with!
