                        <p>In particular, during our last interview with the CFO we learned that he had something <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">significantly more simple in mind </span>and actually <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">ruled out several data points </span>included in the list due to confidentiality reasons. Essentially, he had envisioned a simpler version of the specs provided to us by the data analytics team and shared he will hold the most influence when it comes to the actual production of this.</p>

                        As we began to review the groupings from each key leader’s card sort, we were challenged with trying to <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">find common ground </span>in their results. Our approach was to <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">utilize the home page </span> as the area with the most important points among key leaders.</br></br>

                        I came up with an idea of coloring all of the data points that at least 2 key leaders pulled out of the full list pink. Next I suggested creating three rows ordered by a hierarchy of influence. I put the CFO’s data points together that he saw as the ideal homepage and put the 2 key leaders and data science team under. From here we began to <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">eliminate data points that did not seem to hold enough priority</span> and could therefore be relocated to their respective tabs in the dashboard .

                         </p> <p> This approach ended up being effective and after considering all feedback from the team leads, we were able to provide suggestions on our end for when we next met with the data science team.</p>

            Making Executive Decisions

        <p>At this point, it was becoming more clear that<span style="font-family: sboldbrad;"> the data science team’s specs may not align best with the CFO and the key leaders </span>. We determined moving forward it would be best for us to pitch a modified version of our design that better aligned with all the feedback we recieved from all three groups of people at the company.
        </br></br>
        One major addition to the dashboard was<span style="font-family: sboldbrad;"> introducing two levels to view all data </span>on the dashboard. The first level was <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">by company</span>, allowing users to view statistics for a particular company and the second level was <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">by site</span>, allowing users to go into the multiple sites one company may have that are using Sofvie's products.

        We also included a <span style="font-family: sboldbrad;">time range</span> so that the user could not only compare during a custom range, but also allow a comparison of data points in a given time range to the previous week, 30 days, last billing period, etc.

        After working through our card sort results/discussions, we grouped the data points into three pages: The Home Page, Engagement, and Customers.
