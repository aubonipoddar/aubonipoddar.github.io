          <p>The brief included that the interface also served to create a consistent experience across Disney streaming products, since Disney acquired full control over Hulu in 2019.

            While these changes certainly improved aspects of the experience for a Hulu user, as a personal user myself, I felt that there existed opportunities to improve the browser interface further. I wanted to focus this project around the goals the project management team identified and challenge myself to make meaningful improvements that support them. </p>

                        study</a> conducted by Julia Stoll, within the surveyors age groups, ages 18-29 had the highest percentage of users (41%) who currently have a Hulu subscription. With this in mind, I conducted research with individuals around this age and searched for relatively avid streamer users.<br> <br>
                        I created a google survey that included a screen record of the current home page of Hulu and asked questions regarding their investment in Hulu and what their thoughts are regarding the interface’s current state and potential changes that could reach unmet desires.

                        Hulu vs Netflix

                        (and other streaming services)
                    </h3>

                    <p>In my research, I discovered that users often brought up other existing services like Netflix while explaining what they believed was lacking in Hulu in terms of interface and their experience. Because Hulu is not the only streaming platform people use, it was important to consider what features of competitor’s services are valuable to users because it impacts their expectations when they come across similar services.
                    </br></br>
                    There were two main features underdeveloped in Hulu: <span style="color:#2FB292;font-family: sboldbrad;">previews</span> for shows/show’s information and <span style="color:#2FB292;font-family: sboldbrad;">filters</span>. While these properties somewhat exist on the interface, they require a lot of “finding” on the user’s end with having to click through buttons in order to view information. This “work” makes the process of discovering new content bothersome. Likewise, the search feature, genre feature, and “more information” on shows required users to enter a process that was not as easy to exit out versus services that include preview features (like hovering for more information). This was important to consider as well since part of the expectation that comes with a user determining what show to watch is that the service will allow them to assess the available content in an efficient manner.</p>

                            I addressed the engagement and discovering goals by implementing a preview feature that plays the trailer of a trending show/movie when the user visits the home page. This aims to introduce users to potentially relevant content they may be interested in without requiring any action on their end. By visually displaying the content, the interface is providing suggestions and direction for a user on what they are interested in watching.

                    <p>To minimize the amount of clicking required for a user to access information about a show/movie, I added a hovering feature to allow users to accomplish multiple tasks when hovering their mouse over a show. When a user hovers over a show/movie listing, the show’s rating, release date, genre information, and description displays to the user. Additionally, the user can play the show/movie, add the show/movie to their saved list, and rate the show/movie up or down to help Hulu specialize what is relevant for the user. </p>

            This project was interesting to me because of how strong the correlation was between expectations formed from other streaming services (like Netflix) and complaints/difficulties found with Hulu - acknowledging what features were outdated in context to competitors turned out to be a beneficial strategy for finding solutions to similar problems that others may have already solved. I also learned that when dealing with interfaces that have many buttons and processes, having actions like hovering for a preview, are incredibly efficient solutions.
        </br></br>
        Overall, I enjoyed working on this redesign! Over the course of months I have seen small changes roll out on the actual Hulu interface and I’m curious to see if any of the solutions I proposed are also thought of in the future.
